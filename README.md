### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± **Currently ...**
* *(latest)* maximizing processing with FPGAs. Currently learning how to build a High Frame Rate driver for LED matrices.
  * An intermediate goal: using an *Arduino MKR Vidor 4000* FPGA component as Development Board. You can follow my progress visiting https://github.com/luisgizirian/seven-segment-fpga-driver
* learning about applying HyperLedger Fabric on a use case for Growers, Farmers and Food Producers... (decentralizing with blockchain technologies)
* prototyping a Rust based OS Kernel. Objective: an IOT OS to ease application maintenance (details to come...)
* loving electronics, sensors, and their AI capabilities for in-site (EDGE) inference. Ideas flowing!
* working on understanding Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from an AI perspective, to come up with a real-time fall prevention wearable. Targeted to people with balance disorders
* built @beneater 8-bit computer on a breadboard https://eater.net/8bit/ as a hardware project on the side.
