### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± **Currently ...**
* *(latest)* in an effort to come up with a device to help people with balance disorders during their daily walks, I came across OpenSim (https://opensim.stanford.edu), so I'm trying to discover how this simulator could help on Model Training and Post Analysis phases.
* * main work has taken all time slots. Migrating an old .Net Framework multi-tenant monolith into a dotnet 3.1, 6, 7 microservices architecture to take advantage of Containers and Linux and taking the opportunity of lowering cloud operational costs at the same time. Hope to get back soon enough into the realms of FPGAs, RISC-V and LED Matrices.
* maximizing processing with FPGAs. Currently learning how to build a High Frame Rate driver for LED matrices.
  * An intermediate goal: using an *Arduino MKR Vidor 4000* FPGA component as Development Board. You can follow my progress visiting https://github.com/luisgizirian/seven-segment-fpga-driver
* learning about applying HyperLedger Fabric on a use case for Growers, Farmers and Food Producers... (decentralizing with blockchain technologies)
* prototyping a Rust based OS Kernel. Objective: an IOT OS to ease application maintenance (details to come...)
* loving electronics, sensors, and their AI capabilities for in-site (EDGE) inference. Ideas flowing!
* working on understanding Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from an AI perspective, to come up with a real-time fall prevention wearable. Targeted to people with balance disorders
* built @beneater 8-bit computer on a breadboard https://eater.net/8bit/ as a hardware project on the side.
